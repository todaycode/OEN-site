Welcome to the Angular 2 version of the [Angular UI Bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap) library.
This library is being built from scratch in TypeScript using the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework.

As with Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2, this library is a work in progress. Please check out our list of
[issues](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core/issues) to see all the things we are implementing.
Feel free to make comments there.

This project is being created by the [ui-bootstrap team](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap).
