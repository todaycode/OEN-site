Welcome to the Angular 2 version of the [Angular UI Bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap) library.
This library is being built from scratch by the [ui-bootstrap team](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap).
We are using TypeScript and targeting the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework. 

As with Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2, this library is a work in progress. Please check out our list of
[issues](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core/issues) to see all the things we are implementing.
Feel free to make comments there.

## Supported browsers

We support the same browsers and versions supported by both Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2, whichever is _more_ restrictive.
See [this](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/README.md) for up-to-date Angular 2 browser support.

* Chrome (45+)
* Firefox (40+)
* IE (9+) (but see [Bootstrap 4's notes](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/browsers-devices/#internet-explorer-9) on IE9)
* Edge (20+)
* Safari (7+)
