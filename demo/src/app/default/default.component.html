    Welcome to the Angular 2 version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap">Angular UI Bootstrap</a>
    library. This library is being built from scratch in Typescript using the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework.

  <p class="lead">
    As with Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2, this library is a work in progress.
    Please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/core/wiki/Roadmap" target="_blank">roadmap</a> and
