  <h3>
    Dependencies
  </h3>
  <p>
    This repository contains a set of native Angular 2 directives based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS.
    As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> (<em>requires</em> Angular version 2 or higher)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap CSS</a> (tested with version 4.0aV2)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Getting Help
  </h3>
  <p>
    Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports
    and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> where the community at large are looking
    at questions tagged with <code>ng-bootstrap</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>there are hundreds of people willing to help on StackOverflow,</li>
    <li>questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else, and</li>
    <li>the SO voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.
