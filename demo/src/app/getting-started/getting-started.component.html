      Welcome to the Angular 2 version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap">Angular UI Bootstrap</a>
      library. This library is being built from scratch in Typescript using the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      As with Bootstrap 4 and Angular 2, this library is a work in progress. Please check out our list of issues to see all the things we are implementing. Feel free to make comments there.

      Dependencies
    </h3>
    <p>
      This repository contains a set of native Angular 2 directives based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS.
      As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> (<em>requires</em> Angular version 2 or higher)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap CSS</a> (tested with version 4.0aV2)
      </li>
    </ul>
